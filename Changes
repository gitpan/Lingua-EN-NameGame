	- reformatted some POD documentation for better HTML appearance
	- modified POD documentation slightly in attempt to determine why
	  "=for html" sections for AUTHOR and COPYRIGHT are coming out empty
	- removed explicit dependency on Regexp::Common
		(name2verse_nonprofane.pl needs it, but not the Module)
